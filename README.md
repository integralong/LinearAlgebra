# Linear Algebra by Lauren Song

**Why Linear Algebra Matters?**

In general, linear algebra is the foundational mathehmatical framework that powers neural networks, which in turn have extensive applications in medicine, particularly in diagnostics, medical imaging, and personalized treatment.

- Medical Imaging |  Linear Algebra techniques are used in image reconstruction for MRI and CT scans, and neural networks then analyze these images to detect anomalies such as tumors.

- Clinical Diagnosis and Prediction | ANNs are used to improve accuracy in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and forecasting the spread of diseases. Examples include automated electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation and cancer prediction.

- Personlized and Precision Medicine | Machine learning, including neural networks, helps in tailoring treatments to individual patients by integrating and analyzing diverse clinical data to inform treatment strategies.

- Drug Discovery and Development | Neural networks assist in various stages of drug development and can model complex biological systems, such as the immune system or tumor growth.
